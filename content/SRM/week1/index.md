#### Colaborative Discussion

##### Initial Post

Hancock et al. (2024) explain that the introduction of technology into human rights investigations can pose challenges by introducing new errors and biases, as well as data misinterpretation, which can be challenging to detect when there are no “boots on the ground.” Additionally, data collection can raise concerns about individuals' privacy and freedom, as many organizations fail to adhere to correct legal and ethical guidelines, which can lead to data misuse (Ahmed & Ahammed 2024). On the other hand, many technological solutions are developed without thinking of the vulnerable people they are meant to protect. This is demonstrated in multiple studies, where authors propose solutions that require multiple technologies and communication devices to ensure correct functionality, for instance, blockchain, mesh networks, and satellite communication (Connolly et al., 2023; Mohiqi, 2024). It is essential to note that some authors are aware of the accessibility limitations but still do not work directly with the victims they focus on, leaving critical information needed to develop feasible solutions. In summary, technology introduces new risks to human rights investigations by failing to identify the problems and constraints faced by victims accurately. New technology must consider these factors to ensure effectiveness in addressing issues.



#### Reflexion
+ OOP is a powerful tool for designing solutions to complex problems, ensuring scalability and maintainability. However, this process requires time to thoroughly understand the problem and define the correct classes, data structures, and designs to be used. Personally, I've observed its effectiveness in large projects; however, this additional time investment can be significant depending on if it is a project or just one script.
